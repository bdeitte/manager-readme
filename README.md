# Manager Readme

Hi, I'm Brian. As we start to work together, I want to make sure I can help out you right away, and you understand better how I work. This document is not meant to override the mutual understandings we build up in our relationship, but it's an easy way to jump start them.

## My role

I have a few different roles at Maxwell Health, both in terms of what I do as an engineering manager and as the head of infrastructure. We may talk more about some of these responsibilties in time (or you may be invovled with them!) But my top responsibility is as a people's manager. This is what I see as my priority #1, to enable and grow the talent like you.

## 1:1s

I will make sure we have a 1:1 scheduled weekly, and I will rarely cancel these. I feel 1:1s to be a critical part of how I interact with people. Sometimes we will not have much to talk about, and that's ok. Keeping the rythym and dialogue open is important to me.

You will often hear me say at the start of a 1:1, "is there anything you want to talk about, and is there anything I can do for you?" This may be repeated, but it is meant in earnest every time. I want to be able to help you out, and the 1:1s can be a good way for us to do us.

I keep a list of things in a document that I want to talk about, and I sometimes take notes to myself to look at later.  If I'm looking or writing during a 1:1, it's for this.

I also view 1:1s as a private conversation that we have. I may share with other managers if it's important for me to do so, but I try to keep what we say between us. I view this as important part of a trustful relationship with each other.

## Feedback

If you have feedback for me, you can let me know any time. I find 1:1s a good time for this, but if you find a different communication will work better for you, that's ok.

I will bring up any feedback I have in 1:1s, which falls into everything I discuss above. If you have feedback on the feedback, you may not think of it right away.  That's ok, we can talk anytime. I'm talking about both positive and constructive feedbak here- you will hear both from me.

If you have feedback for other people, it's often best to talk to them. If you want advice on how to do this, we can talk through this. If you don't feel comfortable with this, please let me know, and I can see how else to share.

If you have feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you liked and would like to see more of, something you thought I could do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something that doesn't fit in any of these categories. Even if you think it might not be the case, I do want to hear it. And if you think I don't want to hear it, I'd love to hear why you feel that way.

## Other communication

If you have any issue, you can contact me any time. You may see that my calendar is "busy", or you may hear me say that it's a busy week. Don't have this stop you.

I tend to see both Slack and email quickly, either work fine for me.

I may send you messages at odd hours, late in the evening or on the weekend. Do not take this as a signal that I expect you to be working then- my schedule is sometimes tossed around for family things. Or I may just be choosing to finish up things at a different time, but this is not meant as an indication that you need to do this as well.

## About me

I've been at Maxwell Health for 3 years. I worked for Brightcove before that, and Adobe/Macromedia/Allaire before that. I've been a developer for most of my career.

You'll most hear me talking about my wife or kids (ages 9, 7, and 5 as of this writing). That is a whole lot of my life, along with work, and I enjoy it all! I'm also a lifelong runner.
