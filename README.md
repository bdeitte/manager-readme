# Manager Readme

Hi, I'm Brian. As we start to work together, I want to make sure I can help out you right away, and you understand better how I work. This document is not meant to override the mutual understandings we build up in our relationship, but it's an easy way to jump start them.

## My role

I have a few different roles at Maxwell Health, both in terms of what I do as an engineering manager and as the head of infrastructure. We may talk more about some of these responsibilties in time (or you may be invovled with them!) But my top responsibility is as a people's manager. This is what I see as my priority #1, to enable and grow the talent like you.

## 1:1s

I will make sure we have a 1:1 scheduled weekly, and I will rarely cancel these. These 1:1s will be a critical part of how we interact. Sometimes we will not have much to talk about, and that's ok. Keeping the rythym and dialogue open is important to me.

You will often hear me say at the start of a 1:1, "is there anything you want to talk about, and is there anything I can do for you?" This may be repeated, but it is meant in earnest every time. I want to be able to help you out, and the 1:1s are a good time to talk about this.

I keep a list of things in a document that I want to talk about, and I sometimes take notes to myself to look at later.  If I'm looking or writing during a 1:1, it's for this.

I view 1:1s as a private conversation that we have. I may share with other managers if it's important for me to do so, but I try to keep what we say between us. I see this as important part of a trustful relationship with each other.

## Feedback

If you have feedback for me, or about what you're doing, or anything else, you can let me know any time. The 1:1s usually work well for this. I take the feedback you give very seriously, and you'll see a followup on whatever it is.

I will bring up any feedback I have in 1:1s. You can expect to hear both positive and constructive feedback from me over time, but usually positive. 

## Other communication

If you have any issue, you can contact me any time. You may see that my calendar is "busy", or you may hear me say that it's a busy week. Don't have this stop you. I tend to see both Slack and email quickly, and either work fine for me.

I may send you messages at odd hours, late in the evening or on the weekend. Do not take this as a signal that I expect you to be working then- my schedule is sometimes tossed around for family things. Or I may just be choosing to finish up things at a different time, but this is not meant as an indication that you need to do this as well.

## Your growth

Your growth is up to you, but I will help you in any way I can. I expect at first you'll be learning a lot in your new position, and figuring out how everything works. But sometimes people find themselves, over time, needing new challenges or wanting to learn different things. I can help you with that, and provide support for it. This is something I really enjoy about my job, and I've helped multiple people grow into team leads, for instance. So talk to me about what you're looking for, or make sure you put it in your goals that we'll set over time.

## About me

I've been at Maxwell Health for 3 years. I worked for Brightcove before that, and Adobe/Macromedia/Allaire before that. I've been a developer for most of my career.

You'll most hear me talking about my wife or kids (ages 9, 7, and 5 as of this writing). That is a whole lot of my life, along with work, and I enjoy it all! I'm also a lifelong runner.
